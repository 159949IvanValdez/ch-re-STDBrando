Section 3 will focus on the specific requirements the system has to deliver.
### 2. Overall Description
##### 2.1. Product Perspective
This system consists of a application that will save a number of appointments each one with a set of customer information in a database.
Each time the employee has to create, modify or delete, there will be a number of components in the interface so the system can communicate with the database and apply these changes.

* Create a new patient by the use of a button
* Once created, be able to modify the data of said patient
